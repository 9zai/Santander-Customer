1. try balanced sample
2. parameter tunning for xgb and lgb
3. models ensemble // https://www.kaggle.com/roydatascience/fork-of-eda-pca-simple-lgbm-kfold

#lr performed better in testing but not on board, casual tuning

done smte, time consuming ## and not correct
smte currently have huge effect on the model perfomance, waiting for verification

1. consist the balanced data, sample when training to save time
2. train multiple models to avg ,use different source and distribution of data
3. lgb's performances .. the kernel
